# Data Availability

## Overview

Use this skill to turn manuscript-supporting data into a submission-ready availability package: statement text, repository plan, source-data mapping, and unresolved-risk flags.

This skill is narrower than `submission-audit` and more operational than `scientific-writing`. Use it when the bottleneck is no longer the paper's story, but whether the data-sharing package is specific, durable, and journal-ready.

## When To Use

Use this skill when:
- the manuscript needs a `Data Availability` statement
- accession numbers, DOIs, repository records, or source-data files are missing or unstable
- the paper mixes generated data, reused public data, and restricted data
- "available upon request" wording needs to be tightened or replaced
- a submission or revision needs data-sharing text that editors can audit quickly

Do not use this skill for:
- generic section rewriting unrelated to data sharing
- full manuscript restructuring
- bibliography cleanup that does not affect dataset availability

## Workflow

1. Identify the target journal and article type.
2. Inventory the datasets that support the main and supplementary claims:
   - raw data
   - processed data
   - figure source data
   - reused public datasets
   - code-adjacent outputs that are necessary to inspect the results
3. Assign each dataset one access route only:
   - public repository
   - controlled-access repository
   - within paper or supplement
   - reused public source
   - third-party restricted
   - justified request route
4. Choose repository and identifier strategy before drafting the statement.
5. Draft explicit dataset-to-location wording.
6. Check that the statement covers both newly generated and reused data.
7. Flag unresolved fields rather than inventing repository names, accession IDs, DOIs, or access rules.

## Working Rules

- Prefer public, discipline-specific repositories when possible.
- Treat `available upon request` as weak unless a real legal, ethical, commercial, or third-party restriction exists.
- If data cannot be public, state:
  - why access is restricted
  - who controls access
  - how requests are reviewed
  - what metadata, source data, or derived data remain public
- Do not merge data, code, protocols, and materials into one vague availability sentence unless the journal explicitly wants that.
- Do not invent accession numbers, DOIs, repository names, reviewer links, or embargo terms.
- List only the resources the analyses actually used, and say plainly where they came from ("All
  response data were obtained from [collection], [DOI]"). Resources the study did not use are not
  listed, and an identifier the source does not record is left out rather than confessed as "not
  exposed" or "could not be identified"; flag such gaps to the author instead.
- Promise nothing: state the routes and files that exist now. "On request" and "Source Data files"
  appear only when that route or file is real, and a future release or arranged access ("will be
  released", "planned before acceptance", "can be arranged") is not stated at all.
- Name the scientific content, not the repository layout: no folder paths (`source_data/`), file
  mechanics or workbook instructions in the statement.
- Name the public repositories actually used, for example a Hugging Face dataset for processed
  inputs and a GitHub repository for code, and keep the Code availability statement consistent with
  what the released repository contains.
- A Supplementary Data table of sources has one row per resource used, no column that is identical
  in every row, and publications taken from the manuscript's own bibliography so the two cannot
  disagree. Generate it from the analysis tables where possible.

## Related Files

Open these only when needed:

- `references/statement-patterns.md`
  Use when drafting or repairing the actual statement text.
- `references/repository-routing.md`
  Use when deciding where each dataset should live and what identifier type is needed.
- `references/source-data-checks.md`
  Use when checking whether figures, tables, and supplements expose enough underlying data.
- `references/fair-metadata-checklist.md`
  Use when the journal expects FAIR or DataCite-style dataset metadata, or a formal dataset citation.
- `references/chinese-author-alignment.md`
  Use when aligning a Chinese-language data-availability draft to English submission wording.

## Output Standard

When using this skill, return:
- ready-to-paste `Data Availability` text
- repository and identifier actions still required
- missing information or blocking risks
- a short note on whether the current package is:
  - `ready_to_submit`
  - `draft_with_placeholders`
  - `needs_author_input`
  - `blocked`
