# Section Logic Patterns

Each section's job, dependencies and acceptance criteria are defined once in `paper-workflow`'s
`references/section-contracts.md`. This file gives paragraph-level patterns for applying them;
where the two differ, the contract governs. Use these patterns as diagnostic scaffolds, not rigid
templates.

## Abstract

The Abstract is usually one paragraph, so its logic is a sentence sequence. Reverse-outline it one
sentence at a time: label each sentence with its link in the contract's chain (problem, gap,
approach, evidence, meaning). A sentence with no label goes, and a link with no sentence is a gap.
Background that never becomes relevant and method detail that does not help interpret the result
have no label.

## Introduction

### Paragraph 1: establish the problem

Start with the real scientific goal, not a narrow implementation. Explain why it matters and introduce only the concepts needed to define the problem.

### Paragraph 2: expose the unresolved limitation

Organize prior work by what it can and cannot answer. Avoid a chronological list of model names. End with the precise missing capability, evidence, or understanding.

### Paragraph 3: explain why the gap is difficult

Identify the biological, data, or methodological obstacle. This paragraph should make the study design feel necessary rather than arbitrary.

### Final paragraph: state the study

State the question, approach, primary contribution, and scope. Do not summarize every figure. Avoid promotional claims that the Results must later walk back.

## Results subsection

1. State the question or purpose.
2. Describe the minimum design needed to interpret the comparison.
3. Report the central result with exact direction and magnitude where useful.
4. Add secondary analyses only if they test an alternative explanation or refine the conclusion.
5. End with a bounded takeaway that answers the opening question.

Separate three layers:

- **Observation:** what the data show.
- **Interpretation:** what may explain it.
- **Implication:** why it matters for the study.

Do not present an interpretation as though it were another measured result.

## Discussion

### Opening

State the main advance and the evidence supporting it. Do not reopen with generic field background.

### Interpretation

Explain why the findings matter, how they relate to prior expectations, and which mechanism or explanation is supported. Use the strength of language warranted by the design.

### Generality and limitations

Name the conditions under which the conclusion was established. Explain how data coverage, task definition, model choice, confounding, or validation design limits generalization. A useful limitation changes how a result should be interpreted; it is not a ceremonial disclaimer.

### Closing

End with the concrete scientific implication or next capability. Avoid generic statements that the work `paves the way` unless the next step is specified.

## Paragraph-level reverse outline

For each paragraph, write a five-to-ten-word label describing its job. Then ask:

- Does more than one paragraph perform the same job?
- Does one paragraph perform several unrelated jobs?
- Does each paragraph answer a question created by the previous one?
- Does the first sentence announce the job?
- Is any prerequisite introduced after it is needed?
- Does the final sentence overstate the evidence presented in the paragraph?

Reorder the outline before rewriting sentences.
