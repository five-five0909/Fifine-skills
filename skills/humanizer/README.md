# Humanizer

A skill for Claude Code and OpenCode that removes signs of AI-generated writing from text, making it sound more natural and human.

Upstream: [github.com/blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) (MIT)

## Usage

### Claude Code

```
/humanizer

[paste your text here]
```

Or ask the model directly:

```
Please humanize this text: [your text]
```

### Voice calibration

To match your personal writing style, provide a writing sample:

```
/humanizer

Here's a sample of my writing for voice matching:
[paste 2-3 paragraphs of your own writing]

Now humanize this text:
[paste AI text to humanize]
```

The skill will analyze your sentence rhythm, word choices, and quirks, then apply them to the rewrite.

## Overview

Based on [Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) guide, maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup.

> "LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases."

## Maintenance

`SKILL.md` and this README must stay in sync:

- **Patterns:** currently **33 numbered patterns**. If you add, remove, or renumber any, update the README table and every cross-reference in the same change.
- **Version:** `SKILL.md` frontmatter has a `version:` field. Bump it when behavior changes.
